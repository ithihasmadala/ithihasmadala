I'm Ithihas. Here's some intro:

I'm currently pursuing MSc Biological Sciences and Bachelors in Electronics & Communications at BITS Pilani Goa Campus.
My interests are everevolving, currently they are: Computational Biology, Neuroscience, Robotics, Computer Vision & NLP, Blockchain and Ethical Hacking.
Ask me about Elon Musk or Tesla, it would lead to an OverflowError.
I'm always looking for projects and internships related to my interests, reach out to me by raising an issue here!
